            <p>African Unity represents the foundational principle of continental cooperation, economic integration, and political solidarity among African nations. This ideal, enshrined in organizations like the African Union and regional blocs such as the East African Community (EAC), faces significant challenges when national interests conflict with regional commitments.</p>
            
            <p>The recent trade dispute between Kenya and Tanzania serves as a critical case study examining how protectionist policies can undermine decades of integration efforts and threaten the very fabric of African Unity.</p>

            <h3>Historical Context of EAC Integration</h3>
            <p>The East African Community, established as a regional intergovernmental organization, comprises six Partner States: Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda, with headquarters in Arusha, Tanzania. The EAC represents one of Africa's most ambitious integration projects, built on principles of free movement of goods, services, and people.</p>
            
            <h3>The EAC Common Market Protocol</h3>
            <p>Article 13 of the EAC Common Market Protocol guarantees the fundamental right of establishment and freedom to conduct business without discrimination among member states. This protocol forms the legal backbone of regional economic integration and embodies core African Unity principles.</p>

            <h2 id="dispute-heading">Current Dispute: Tanzania's Business Licensing Ban</h2>
            
            <h3>The Controversial Policy</h3>
            <p>In July 2025, Tanzania announced the Business Licensing (Prohibition of Business Activities for Non-Citizens) Order, 2025, effectively banning foreigners from engaging in 15 categories of small and medium-sized business activities. This policy directly affects EAC citizens and has sparked the most serious diplomatic crisis between Kenya and Tanzania in recent years.</p>
            
            <h4>Prohibited Business Categories</h4>
            <ul role="list">
                <li>Mobile money transfer services</li>
                <li>Electronics repair and maintenance</li>

                <li>Wholesale and retail trade</li>
                <li>General service provision</li>

            </ul>
            
            <h3>Kenya's Response and Diplomatic Protest</h3>
            <p>Kenya has formally protested the decision through multiple channels, calling it discriminatory and a clear violation of EAC protocols. Trade Minister Moses Kuria warned of potential reciprocal measures, stating that "reciprocity remains an option should Tanzania disregard Kenya's concerns."</p>
            
            <aside role="complementary" aria-labelledby="tensions-sidebar">
                <h4 id="tensions-sidebar">Rising Diplomatic Tensions</h4>
                <p>Kenyan lawmakers have escalated rhetoric, with some proposing bans on Tanzanian-operated businesses and individuals, including informal traders. The situation has created the most significant strain in Kenya-Tanzania relations since the EAC's revival.</p>
            </aside>
            
            <h3>Tanzania's Justification</h3>
            <p>Tanzanian officials and local traders support the ban as a protective measure for domestic businesses. Severin Moshi, chairman of the Kariakoo Traders' Association in Dar es Salaam, argued that the policy "restores fairness to the market" by addressing unfair competition from foreign operators.</p>

            <h3>Challenges to Regional Integration</h3>
            <p>The Kenya-Tanzania dispute represents a fundamental challenge to African Unity principles, highlighting the tension between national sovereignty and regional integration commitments. This conflict demonstrates how easily decades of integration progress can be undermined by unilateral policy decisions.</p>
            
            <h4>Impact on EAC Member States</h4>
            <p>Rwanda and Uganda have also expressed concern over Tanzania's policy, fearing a domino effect that could unravel the entire Common Market framework. The dispute threatens to create a precedent for protectionist policies across the region.</p>

            <h3>Diplomatic Engagement</h3>
            <p>The planned bilateral summit in August 2025 represents a crucial opportunity for diplomatic resolution. Originally focused on tobacco trade and customs issues, these meetings will now prioritize addressing the business licensing dispute.</p>

            <h4>Recommended Solutions</h4>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Immediate Policy Review:</strong> Tanzania should reconsider the blanket ban and develop more nuanced regulations that protect local businesses while maintaining EAC compliance</li>
                <li><strong>Enhanced Consultation:</strong> Future policy changes affecting regional integration should involve comprehensive EAC consultation processes</li>
                <li><strong>Dispute Resolution Mechanisms:</strong> Strengthen existing EAC institutions to handle integration-related conflicts more effectively</li>
                <li><strong>Graduated Implementation:</strong> Consider phased approaches to business regulation that balance protection with integration commitments</li>
                <li><strong>Compensation Frameworks:</strong> Develop support mechanisms for affected businesses during policy transitions</li>

            <h2 id="conclusion-heading">Conclusion: The Future of African Unity</h2>
            
            <p>The Kenya-Tanzania trade dispute serves as a critical test case for African Unity in the 21st century. While Tanzania's desire to protect local businesses is understandable, the unilateral approach threatens the foundational principles of regional integration that have taken decades to establish.</p>
            
            <p>The resolution of this conflict will significantly impact not only bilateral Kenya-Tanzania relations but also the broader trajectory of African economic integration. Success in finding a balanced solution could strengthen EAC institutions and provide a model for handling similar conflicts across Africa.</p>
            
            <p>Ultimately, this crisis highlights the need for more robust consultation mechanisms, stronger institutional frameworks, and a renewed commitment to the African Unity ideals that underpin regional integration efforts across the continent.</p>
            
            <p>As the August bilateral summit approaches, the international community watches to see whether diplomacy and commitment to regional integration will prevail over protectionist tendencies, determining the future direction of African Unity in East Africa and beyond.</p>
